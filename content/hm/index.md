## SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM THE HEADMASTER.
Dear parents/guardians, staff and pupils, it is with immense pride and joy that we address you through this special school handle.  We are thrilled to extend our warm welcome to each of you to our mighty school Kyengera Parents’ Mugongo. It is truly a privilege to serve as the Headteacher of such a vibrant and excelling educational institution.

Our school is a branch of Sir Apollo Kaggwa/CPS schools and we believe in providing a holistic education and credible learning environment which help to produce dynamic and talented Ugandan citizens.

Every year, we navigate around our vision of “Being the number one education service provider in East Africa”, which we believe can be achieved through prioritizing unique etiquette, talent development programme in addition to a robust academic curriculum.

We encourage creativity and critical thinking in our classrooms and we foster a sense of cultural and religious diversity amongst our learners.

We are excited about the opportunities and achievements that lie a head and look forward to working closely with each of you as we continue to build a brighter future for our children.

Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s education.

Yours in service,


### MPERESE JOHN BOSCO
